Description-
Project for UnitedbyHCL. Our aim is to build an Chat Bot for NBC Universal which access the user’s Location , ask them about their surroundings and inform the other users in vicinity about the important information It also inform the users about the nearby events

The app ask questions regarding the user’s location in chat head form where user may answer them or go directly to the application where he/she can answer more related questions. These question are mostly in Yes/No form If the user is moving, the app will automatically ask about the location after they displaced 5 Kilometers from the previous location All users will be notified by push notifications as well Important Notifications tab in our application about the location they are visiting ( all the important updates such as roadblocks, traffic etc)

In Application user can view events nearby to his location and also they can create their own events to promote them. While creating they can set the events priority by considering paying option in the app if they want their event to be in the top of the nearby events list for some fix number of hours.

Application promote events as they tell its users about the event happening in their nearby surroundings( through ‘NearBy Events‘ section of our app) According to the events priority set in the Create Event part of application, the app ask for negligible payment from the users for their promotion Sponsored Events are welcomed too in our application.
